# 20GamesAsteroids
 A clone of the arcade game Asteroids made for the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/asteroids/).  The goal of this project was to learn how to create a more advanced character controller for a 2d game. I used the Godot game engine due to it being free and open source as C# as it is my personal language of choice when programming.

 ## Controls
 MAIN MENU CONTROLS:<br>
 Up/Down Arrows - Navigate menu<br>
 Space - Accept <br>

 PLAYER SHIP CONSTROLS:<br>
 W/Up Arrow - Thrust<br>
 A/Left Arrow - Rotate Left<br>
 D/Right Arrow - Rotate Right<br>
 Space - Shoot<br>
 T - Teleport<br>
